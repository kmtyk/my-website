            Hello, my name is <strong>Yuki</strong>. <br>
            I live in Japan.
            I'm in the third year of junior high school.
            I spend most of my time studying.

          <p>
            The first programming language I was exposed to was Scratch.
            That was when I was in elementary school.<br>
            From there, I went on to learn languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Currently, I'm exposed to languages such as C# and Python.
